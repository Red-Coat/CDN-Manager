# K8s CDN Controller

The CDN Controller is a kubernetes addon which sets up Distributions in
CDNs automatically pointing to ingress / service resources.

Its technical design has drawn some inspiration from [cert-manager][1].


**This product is still in early alpha stage - not all features may be
supported, and things may change without notice.**
